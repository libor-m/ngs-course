Aftermath
=========

- make /data read only, to be sure they don't delete own data, and
  to simulate shared environment
- variant quality task takes ~1 hour
- do not forget 'man'
- consider command chaining (ln, then work with linked data) .. but probably 
  yes, so they have to see that the steps have to be done...
