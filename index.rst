Course on Unix and work with genomic data - Prague, November 2021
=================================================================

This course is taught regularly as a subject in the winter term at the Department of Zoology, Faculty of Science,
Charles University in Prague (`MB170C47 <https://is.cuni.cz/studium/eng/predmety/index.php?do=predmet&kod=MB170C47>`_).

The aim of the course is to introduce the participants to Unix - an interface that is
one of the most convenient options for working with big data in text formats.
Special attention is given to working with Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)
data. Most of the NGS data formats are intentionally text-based because the
authors wanted to use Unix for most of the processing. Like that they can focus
on the real problem they're solving without having to program special tools for
the mundane tasks, which can all be handled by combining basic Unix tools.

We'll be using `Slack 'UNIX and NGS' <https://ngs-course.slack.com>`_ to share
