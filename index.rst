Course on UNIX and work with genomic data - Prague, November 2020
=================================================================

This course is taught regularly as a subject in the winter term at the Department of Zoology, Faculty of Science,
Charles University in Prague (`MB170C47 <https://is.cuni.cz/studium/eng/predmety/index.php?do=predmet&kod=MB170C47>`_).

It aims to introduce the participants to UNIX - an interface that is
one of the most convenient options for working with big textual data.
Special attention is put on working with Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)
data. Most of the NGS data formats are intentionally text based because the
authors wanted to use UNIX for the processing. By combining basic UNIX tools
one can achieve results that would require programming or finding specialized
software for each of the tasks in other environments.

Not knowing 'the right way' to do things can be intimidating for beginners, so
an additional section exploring 'best practice' is available for self
learning.
