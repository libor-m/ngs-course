Course on UNIX and Genomic Data - Prague, January 2016
======================================================

This course aims to introduce the participants to UNIX - an interface that is one of the most convenient
options for working with big data. Special attention is put on working with Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) data.
Most of the NGS data formats were designed to be textual, and textual data is where UNIX excels in its versatility.
By combining basic UNIX tools one can achieve results that would require finding specialized software
in other environments.

Not knowing 'the right way' to do things can be intimidating for the beginning users, so an additional section
exploring the 'best practice' is available for self learning.
